LEGISLATION
=======================

This file identifies and defines the legislation that makes up the four causes we are exploring. 

========================
I. TRANSGENDER LEGISLATION
========================

The Matthew Shepard and James Byrd Hate Crimes Prevention Act
Conceived as a response to the murders of Matthew Shepard and James Byrd, Jr., the measure expands the 1969 United States federal hate-crime law to include crimes motivated by a victim's actual or perceivedgender, sexual orientation, gender identity, or disability.
Removes the prerequisite that the victim be engaging in a federally protected activity, like voting or going to school;
Gives federal authorities greater ability to engage in hate crimes investigations that local authorities choose not to pursue;
Provides $5 million per year in funding for fiscal years 2010 through 2012 to help state and local agencies pay for investigating and prosecuting hate crimes;
Requires the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) to track statistics on hate crimes based on gender and gender identity (statistics for the other groups were already tracked).

========================
II. MASS INCARCERATION
========================
The Smarter Sentencing Act, S. 1410
The bill does not repeal any federal mandatory minimum sentences, but instead reduces prison costs and populations by creating fairer, less costly minimum terms for nonviolent drug offenders. 
The bill will permit 8,800 federal prisoners (87% of which are black) who are imprisoned for crack cocaine crimes to return to court to seek fairer punishments in line with the Fair Sentencing Act, a unanimously-passed measure that reduced the racially discriminatory disparity between crack and powder cocaine sentences in 2010. 
Sentence reductions will not be automatic, and courts have ably handled similar requests from even larger numbers of people in the past. 
39% chance of being enacted per https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/113/s1410

Recidivism Reduction and Public Safety Act
The bill is anticipated to help alleviate overcrowding in federal prisons — now at 138 percent of their capacity — and may help reduce federal prison costs, which consume a full quarter of the Department of Justice’s budget and threaten funding for other law enforcement programs
Requires the federal Bureau of Prisons to classify all federal prisoners as being at high, moderate, or low risk of reoffending;
Permits many prisoners to earn time credits for completing recidivism-reducing programs or “productive activities” like maintaining a prison job; and
Allows low and moderate risk prisoners who earn a certain number of time credits to be released from prison early to serve the remainders of their sentences on prerelease custody in a halfway house, on home confinement, or under community supervision.
Earned Compliance Credit Act
For corrections agencies to efficiently allocate supervision, they must have the authority to focus their staff, services and sanctions on higher-risk offenders.
Agenciesmove lower-risk probationers and parolees to less-intensive levels of supervision—or off of supervision altogether—if they are fulfilling their obligations and conditions, including paying restitution. 
This act creates an “earned compliance credit” that would reduce the time that low-risk, non-violent offenders are on active supervision by 15 days for each month that they are in full compliance with their conditions of supervision, including payment of restitution to crime victims.
