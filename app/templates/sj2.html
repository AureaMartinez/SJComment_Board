		<h1>MASS INCARCERATION</h1>
			<p>The Smarter Sentencing Act, S. 1410
			The bill does not repeal any federal mandatory minimum sentences, but instead reduces prison costs and populations by creating fairer, less costly minimum terms for nonviolent drug offenders. 
			The bill will permit 8,800 federal prisoners (87% of which are black) who are imprisoned for crack cocaine crimes to return to court to seek fairer punishments in line with the Fair Sentencing Act, a unanimously-passed measure that reduced the racially discriminatory disparity between crack and powder cocaine sentences in 2010. 
			Sentence reductions will not be automatic, and courts have ably handled similar requests from even larger numbers of people in the past. 
			39% chance of being enacted per https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/113/s1410</p>
